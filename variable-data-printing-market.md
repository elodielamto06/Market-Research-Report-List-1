<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Variable Data Printing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Release Liner</li><li>Linerless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Variable Data Printing (VDP) market consists of two key types: release liner and linerless printing. Release liner involves a backing material that separates from the printed label, making it easy to peel and apply. This method is commonly used for adhesive labels where a protective layer is needed before application. Linerless printing, on the other hand, eliminates this backing, allowing for more efficient use of materials and reduced waste. Both methods cater to diverse applications, enhancing customization and operational efficiency.</p></p>
