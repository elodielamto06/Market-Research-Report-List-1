<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brachytherapy Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Dose Rate</li><li>Low Dose Rate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Brachytherapy equipment encompasses two main market types: High Dose Rate (HDR) and Low Dose Rate (LDR). HDR delivers a high radiation dose in a short period, allowing for precise treatment of tumors while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissue. It typically uses afterloading techniques with sealed sources. Conversely, LDR involves a continuous, lower dose of radiation over an extended period, often utilizing permanent or temporary implants. Both methods are crucial in effectively treating various cancers while tailoring patient-specific therapeutic approaches.</p></p>
