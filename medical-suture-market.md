<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Suture</li><li>Non-absorbable Suture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical suture market is divided into two primary types: absorbable and non-absorbable sutures. Absorbable sutures are designed to dissolve over time, eliminating the need for removal and are typically used for internal procedures where healing occurs over weeks. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, remain intact until manually removed, making them suitable for external wounds or areas requiring long-term support. The choice between these sutures depends on the surgical technique and the nature of the tissue being repaired.</p></p>
